# work-day-scheduler.
## Create a Work day scheduler containing the following:
```
When I open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When I scroll down, then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
When I view the time blocks for that day, then each time block is color-coded to indicate 
whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When I click into a time block, then I can enter an event.
When I click the save button for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
When I refresh the page, the the saved events persist.
```
